# MLOps Learning Project

This repository documents my journey through a structured 4-week MLOps learning plan. I'll be updating this README daily to track progress, share insights, and document what I've learned.

```

## Learning Progress

### Week 1: Foundations & Environment Setup

#### Day 1 – Introduction to MLOps (Complete)

**What I Learned:**
- MLOps is the practice of applying DevOps principles to machine learning systems
- Key challenges in ML production: reproducibility, versioning, deployment, monitoring
- The full ML lifecycle from data collection to model monitoring
- How MLOps bridges the gap between experimental ML and production-ready systems

**Resources Explored:**
- Made With ML's MLOps Guide
- DataTalksClub's MLOps course overview
- Google Cloud's MLOps Architecture Pattern

**Key Insights:**
- MLOps isn't just about tools but about establishing reliable processes
- The most significant MLOps challenges are often organizational, not technical
- Models can degrade over time due to data drift and concept drift
- Automation is essential for reliable ML systems at scale

**Learning Journal Entry:** Created a dedicated Notion page to document MLOps concepts and best practices.

**MLOps Lifecycle Diagram:** Created a basic diagram showing the key stages: data preparation, model development, deployment, monitoring, and feedback loops.

#### Day 2 – Environment Setup (Complete)

**What I Learned:**
- Best practices for setting up an ML development environment
- The importance of reproducible environments using virtual environments
- How to structure an ML project directory for better organization
- Tools that form the foundation of an MLOps workflow

**Environment Components Installed:**
- Python 3.9 via Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab
- VS Code with Python and Jupyter extensions
- Git for version control
- Created GitHub repository for this learning journey

**Project Structure Created:**
- Implemented the cookiecutter data science project structure
- Set up .gitignore with ML-specific patterns
- Configured a virtual environment and requirements.txt

**Key Insights:**
- Environment consistency is crucial for ML reproducibility
- Virtual environments prevent dependency conflicts between projects
- A well-organized project structure saves time and reduces errors
- Documentation should be treated as a first-class citizen from day one

## Next Steps

- Day 3: Learn Git & GitHub workflow best practices for ML projects
- Day 4: Introduction to Docker for containerization
- Complete Week 1 to establish a solid foundation in MLOps tools
